# Wiremock Examples

This repository explores the features of [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org).

It uses [Spring-Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) for exposing and consuming a simple REST service.

## The server

A simple REST endpoint is implemented in `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.service.SampleController`.
It exposes `Sample`s at [http://localhost:8080/sample/]. Otherwise nothing special is happening of note.
The server is started by running `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.service.SampleApplication`.

## The client

Also a simple REST client (org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClient) is implemented.
The client can be run by starting `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClientApplication`.
It tries to consume [http://localhost:8080/sample/] via GET.

The client is the actual target for the tests using Wiremock.

A typical Spring MockMvc test is implemented in `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.SampleControllerClientIT`.

## Wiremock

Wiremock can be used in standalone mode and via unit tests.

### Scenarios

#### Stubbing

See `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.SampleControllerStubbingTest`.

#### Faults

See `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.SampleControllerFailTest`.

* Request Timeouts
* Socket Timeout
* Bad response

#### Record and Playback

This is based on running Wiremock as a proxy. This section explains the steps to set it up for recording requests to the
sample server and serve them back afterwards.

. Start sample server
. Start Wiremock in proxy mode
. Record request
. Stop sample server
. Start Wiremock in playback mode
. Start client and watch recorded request being served


## Bucket list

- [ ] Try out standalone mode
- [ ] Try record and playback
- [x] Using it in unittests
